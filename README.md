## 📝 Project Task

Create an advanced, dynamic and interactive Dashboard using Power BI.

I also wrote a user story to structure my project with, which was:

**As a**… Reporting Analyst;    **I want** … to give meaningful insights with great visuals from this database by creating a Financial Dashboard with Profit Analysis using solely Power BI;    **So I can**… practice and demonstrate my skills.

**NOTE:** I used the Financial Sample dataset from Microsoft which can be downloaded from Power BI Desktop.

## ✏️ **Steps**

- ###### Step 1.

Load the dataset from Power BI Desktop.

- ###### Step 2.

Formatted the dataset using Power Query editor.

- ###### Step 3.

Created all the measures I needed and hosted them in a new disconnected table which named it Key_Measures.

- ###### Step 4.

In order to have a better analysis and more meaningful insights, i had to create a date table and connected it with my primary table which named it Calendar.

- ###### Step 5.
