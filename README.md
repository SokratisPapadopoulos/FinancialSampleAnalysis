## 📝 Project Task

Create an advanced, dynamic and interactive Dashboard using Power BI.

I also wrote a user story to structure my project with, which was:

**As a**… Reporting Analyst;    **I want** … to give meaningful insights with great visuals from this database by creating a Financial Dashboard with Profit Analysis using solely Power BI;    **So I can**… practice and demonstrate my skills.

**NOTE:** I used the Financial Sample dataset from Microsoft which can be downloaded from Power BI Desktop.

## ✏️ **Steps**

- ###### Step 1.

Load the dataset to Microsoft SQL Server.

- ###### Step 2.

Answered basic questions using the first table ‘WorldCups’ of the dataset.

- ###### Step 3.

Answered basic questions using the second table ‘WorldCupMatches’ of the dataset.

- ###### Step 4.

For Quality assurance I checked my results in the excel just to make sure that I don't have any discrepancies with the source streams.

- ###### Step 5.

Exported 3 new CSV’s files from the queries.
1. WorldCups_Cleaned
2. WorldCupMatches_Cleaned
3. WorldCupMatches_Tableau which is the viewtable I created with SQL for the calculations and the visualizations.

- ###### Step 6.

Create the data model after cleansed and prepared tables were read into Tableau.

- ###### Step 7.

Had to create 2 calculations fields to present teams with Finals and Semifinals.

- ###### Step 8.

Final Dashboard
